v0:

The TestCase file RPRv2Aircraft-2015-TC (MS Word) and TestProtocol file RPRv2Aircraft-2015-TP (MS Excel) 
is a first approach to get a pattern for this kind of tests (RPR v2 platform object classes).

The TestCase file contains the Test Purpose and instruction what shall be tested and in 
some cases how it shall be done.

The TestProtocol file contains a Excel-sheet defining the scope of the test (the attributes),
a column for the Conformance Statement according to managed attributes by the SuT
and the requirements to manage attributes at different levels of Capability Badges. 

The SuT owner shall update the column Conformance Statement in the TestProtocol.
The Accredited Test Laboratory shall update the TestProtocol with the outcome of the tests.


v0.1:

Splited up the test in two test cases, one for a provider and a one for a consumer.
It may become many badges, but it may be necessary, to have one common badge will make it hard for e.g.
a very capable provider but not that capable consumer to have a high value badge.
